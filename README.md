# f1_analysis

Run some analysis on F1 team and driver performance over the course of a season, producing a combined metric that represents and combines grid position, final position, average and best lap times.  Download and process the FIA Car Presentation Summary documents (PDFs) to extract the number and type of upgrades brought by each team to each race, and combine this with the race performance to see if there is a corrlation.

The project was built using the free tier of Github Codespaces.

## Method

The how is key here, as this was intended as an experimental use of GitHub Copilot to write the code, along with use of Gemini for some document processing as below.  The output data was loaded into Tableau Public for some visualations.

The vast majority of the code is written directly by Copilot; I have only tweaked a handful of lines at most by hand.  I found it more effective when I knew the structure of the code I wanted to write, and asked it to work on specific functions.  Otherwise, the code quickly became muddled and difficult to read.

The Open F1 API is well documented, however that didn't stop Copilot from hallucinating some endpoints that don't exist.  It took some coercing to get it to specifically stick to existing endpoints.

Surprise surprise, it's all about the prompting.

AFTER I had completed the project and and was just tidying and tinkering, Copilot reported "chat quota reached" for the month, and would reset next month.  This felt like a reasonable amount to achieve for a fun side-project in that time.

## Processing the FIA documents

I could not coerce Copilot to write code that would parse the PDF FIA car submission documents, even though they are a relatively simple tabular structure.  Rather than flog that one relentlessly, I got Gemini to process them for me, and write the outputs into a tabular format that can be appended to the bottom of "2025_fia_car_presentations.xlsx".  Of the various LLM coding tools I tried, Gemini had the most capacity to process files with the free tier.

### Gemini prompt to process FIA Car Presentation Summaries

> Please can you analyse the attached files.  I would like you to create a single combined tabular structured output for all of them.  There will be a row in the table for each individual upgrade component.  Each row in the table will contain:
> - the filename which this came from
> - the team name
> - all of the columns from the upgrades table in the file
> 
> Please do not include any rows in the output table when there were no upgrades for that team in that race.

# Outputs

A sample visualisation generated by passing the final output file "f1_driver_perf_upgrades.xlsx" to Tableau Public is below.  This has a clear example where the LLM processing of the FIA Car Presentation Summary documents was incorrect; Haas had four component upgrades at Silverstone (race 12), but the extract only caught one.  Checking that specific document, it is apparent that Haas combined some of the table values across multiple columns in the PDF, which must have confused Gemini.

# All documentation below here is auto-generated!

A toolkit for analyzing Formula 1 car upgrades, driver performance, and FIA documentation.

## Project Structure

- `common.py`: Defines shared constants (file paths, folder names) and a logging setup utility.
- `download_fia_docs.py`: CLI tool to add FIA car presentation PDF URLs to a cache and download missing PDFs to a local folder.
- `performance_rating.py`: Processes driver race stats, normalizes performance metrics, and outputs a performance rating CSV.
- `process_upgrades.py`: Loads, maps, and groups car upgrade data, merges it with FIA docs and driver performance, and outputs a combined Excel file.
- `query_race_stats.py`: Fetches race, driver, and lap data from the OpenF1 API, computes stats, and caches results.
- `tidy_race_stats.py`: Cleans and enriches the driver stats CSV with driver surnames and standardized team names.

## Data Files

- `data/f1_driver_stats.csv`: Cached driver stats (populated by `query_race_stats.py` and processed by others).
- `data/f1_driver_perf.csv`: Processed driver performance ratings (output of `performance_rating.py`).
- `data/fia_docs.csv`: FIA car presentation document metadata (managed by `download_fia_docs.py`).
- `data/2025_fia_car_presentations.xlsx`: Raw car upgrade data.
- `data/f1_driver_perf_upgrades.xlsx`: Final merged output of driver performance and upgrades.

## Usage

### 1. Download and Manage FIA Docs

Add new FIA car presentation PDFs and download missing files:

```sh
python download_fia_docs.py
```

### 2. Query Race Stats

Fetch and cache driver stats from OpenF1:

```sh
python query_race_stats.py
```

### 3. Tidy Race Stats

Standardize and enrich the driver stats CSV:

```sh
python tidy_race_stats.py
```

### 4. Rate Driver Performance

Normalize and score driver performance:

```sh
python performance_rating.py
```

### 5. Process Upgrades and Merge Data

Combine upgrades, FIA docs, and driver performance:

```sh
python process_upgrades.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `requests`).
